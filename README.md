# Casual Capture
A small text input GUI tied to a global hotkey that is hidden until it's needed. The idea is to have a fast way to capture ideas without switching focus from the current program.
Built using Python and the Tkinter library to keep it lightweight and cross-platform with Windows, Linux, and (hopefully) MacOS. The end-goal is to have a platform agnostic tool that can capture ideas, notes, links, images, etc... quickly in the background from a portable USB stick, storage drive, or just on the local device. Built with notetakers, developers and sysadmins in mind.
# Setting Up
To setup the project you just need to clone this repository to your local machine, create your Python virtual environment, install the requirements from `requirements.txt`, and run the main.py file.
At some point there will be executables created for each OS and a script to launch the correct executable for the OS in use (thinking from a portable version standpoint). But for now it has to be built locally until the development is a bit more complete.
